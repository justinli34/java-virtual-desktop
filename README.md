# ArkNet

## Description

ArkNet is a mystery-adventure game set in a post-apocalyptic world where you must uncover the secrets of a lost system.
Players will work through an operating system with various apps, uncovering clues and solving puzzles to progress the story.
This game is for anyone who enjoys mysteries or working through computer systems. The storyline is based on decision-making.

## Story

In the year 2000, Arch Technologies stumbles upon an archaic system hidden among the remnants of the internet. 
ArkNet is a mysterious relic of civilization before its destruction.
As a hired explorer, you must delve into the depths of ArkNet and discover its secrets. 
But you are not alone. Rival factions are also after the system's secrets, and they will stop at nothing to get it. 
At the core of ArkNet is _The Ark_, which Arch Technologies believes holds the key to restoring order to the new world. 
Will you find out the truth behind humanity's downfall, or will you share its fate?

## Motivation

This project is of interest to me because I love computers and video games.
Mysteries have always captivated me and I want to try creating my own. 
Also, I enjoy the aesthetic of vintage operating systems and would like to emulate that feeling with ArkNet.
This game is inspired by games like _Hypnospace Outlaw_, _Citizen Sleeper_, and _Papers, Please_.
