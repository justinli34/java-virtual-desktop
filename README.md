# Wave Rider

## Description

*Wave Rider* is a 2D game centered around the music listening experience.
Players will ride a bike through levels, traversing sound waves and unlocking new songs as they go. 
Songs can be added to playlists, which then turn into new levels. 
The application will contain a number of pre-selected songs and players will be able to add new tracks by uploading local files.  

With beautiful landscapes, smooth gameplay, and awesome music, *Wave Rider* is for anyone seeking relaxation in today's fast-paced world.

## Motivation

This project is of personal interest to me because I love music and video games. 
Whenever I play a game, I usually have music on in the background. 
In this project, I want to experiment with having music in the foreground of the game, while gameplay takes the backseat.
I am also a fledgling music producer and would like to include a few of my own songs in the game.
