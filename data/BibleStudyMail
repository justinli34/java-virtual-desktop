Re: Exploring John 1

Dear group,

Let's dive into the Gospel of John together! Our next focus will be chapter 1.

In this chapter, we'll uncover the profound revelation of Jesus as the Word made flesh and the light of the world.

Come prepared by reading John chapter 1 beforehand. See you there!

Blessings,
Marissa
